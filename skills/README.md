# Skills

Skills are portable domain knowledge that teach AI coding assistants and end-user platforms how to accomplish HCLS workflows. Each skill contains instructions, executable scripts, and reference documentation.

## Structure

```

├── SKILL.md          ← Instructions (YAML frontmatter + markdown body)
├── scripts/          ← Executable code the AI assistant runs (Python, bash)
└── references/       ← Domain documentation loaded on-demand for context

## How Skills Work

1. AI assistant loads the SKILL.md into context (triggered by user request matching the skill's description)
2. SKILL.md provides step-by-step workflow instructions
3. When execution is needed, the assistant runs scripts from `scripts/`
4. When domain context is needed, the assistant reads files from `references/`
5. When AWS infrastructure actions are needed, the skill directs the assistant to use the appropriate AWS MCP server (HealthOmics, Athena, aws-mcp, etc.)

## Using Skills Across Platforms

| Platform | How skills are consumed |
|----------|----------------------|
| Claude Code | Loaded via plugin install, referenced in context |
| Kiro | Adapted to POWER.md + steering/ format |
| Codex | Loaded via .codex-plugin skills path |
| Amazon Quick | Copied to ~/.quickwork/skills/ |
| Strands agents | Loaded via AgentSkills at runtime |
| AgentCore Registry | Registered as AGENT_SKILLS records for dynamic discovery |
