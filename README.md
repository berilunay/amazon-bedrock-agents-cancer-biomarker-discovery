# Healthcare and Life Sciences Agents Toolkit on AWS

A library of healthcare and life sciences domain capabilities — reference agents with best practices, reusable skills, and MCP-based tools — serving builders in their IDEs, researchers in Amazon Quick, and developers deploying to AWS.

> **Note:** This repository is being repositioned to expose HCLS domain capabilities as portable skills and MCP tools across AI coding assistants and end-user platforms, alongside the existing agent catalog. See the [framework design](docs/proposals/framework-design.md) for technical details.

## Overview

The HCLS Agents Toolkit provides domain-specific AI capabilities for healthcare and life sciences workflows on AWS. The catalog of 36+ reference agents is being decomposed into individual skills (domain knowledge) and MCP servers (domain tools) — making the same capabilities accessible across multiple consumption paths without requiring full agent deployment:

| Path | Who | How |
|------|-----|-----|
| **AI Coding Assistants** (Claude Code, Kiro, Codex) | Developers building HCLS agents | Install skills + connect MCP servers |
| **End-User Platforms** (Amazon Quick, Claude Co-work) | Researchers, clinicians, scientists | Connect to HCLS MCP tools via natural language |
| **Agent Deployments** (Amazon Bedrock AgentCore) | Platform teams, operations | Deploy reference agents with best practices |

## Toolkit Components

### Agents Catalog

Library of 36+ specialized reference agents spanning drug research, clinical trials, genomics, and commercialization. Each agent demonstrates best practices for building with the [Strands](https://strandsagents.com/) framework and deploying to [Amazon Bedrock AgentCore](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/).

**[agents_catalog/](agents_catalog/)**

Highlights:
- [Research agent with 30+ Biomni database tools](agents_catalog/28-Research-agent-biomni-gateway-tools/) — AgentCore Gateway + Runtime
- [Variant interpreter with HealthOmics](agents_catalog/17-variant-interpreter-agent/) — Genomics at scale
- [Terminology agent with OLS](agents_catalog/35-Terminology-agent/) — Ontology standardization
- [C4LS agent with AgentSkills](agents_catalog/36-C4LS-agent/) — Skills + MCP at runtime

### MCP Servers

Domain tools exposed as MCP endpoints, organized by deployment model:

**[mcp-servers/](mcp-servers/)**

| Category | What it provides | Example |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| `agentcore-gateway/` | Deploy CloudFormation → MCP endpoint via AgentCore Gateway | Biomni (30+ biomedical databases) |
| `agentcore-runtime/` | Deploy MCP server container to AgentCore Runtime | OLS (200+ ontologies) |
| `aws-public/` | Pre-existing AWS MCP servers (no deploy) | AWS Knowledge, HealthOmics |
| `third-party/` | Pre-existing public servers (no deploy) | PubMed, Open Targets |

### Skills

Portable domain knowledge that teaches AI assistants how to accomplish HCLS workflows. Skills reference MCP servers by name and describe queries in natural language — no hardcoded tool names.

**[skills/](skills/)**

| Domain | Skills |
|--------|--------|
| Genomics | Variant interpretation, single-cell QC, HealthOmics workflows |
| Drug Discovery | Target identification, compound optimization, safety signals, drug labels |
| Clinical Trials | Trial search, protocol generation, enrollment monitoring |
| Biomarkers | Database analysis, multi-agent discovery, pathway analysis |
| Research | Biomedical databases, deep literature review |
| Terminology | Ontology lookup, data harmonization |

### Platform Guides

Per-platform setup instructions to connect skills and MCP servers to your preferred AI tool.

**[platforms/](platforms/)**

| Platform | Guide |
|----------|-------|
| Claude Code | [platforms/claude-code/](platforms/claude-code/) |
| Amazon Quick | [platforms/q-desktop/](platforms/q-desktop/) |
| Kiro | [platforms/kiro/](platforms/kiro/) |

## Quick Start

### For Developers (Claude Code / Kiro)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-bedrock-agents-healthcare-lifesciences.git
cd amazon-bedrock-agents-healthcare-lifesciences

# 2. Follow platform-specific setup
cat platforms/claude-code/README.md   # or platforms/kiro/
```

Setup installs HCLS skills, connects MCP servers, and enables natural language queries like:

> "Look up human insulin protein and give me the UniProt ID"
> "What diseases are associated with EGFR?"
> "What are the children of seizure (HP:0001250) in HPO?"

For building and deploying agents on AWS, pair this with the [AWS Agent Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/agent-toolkit-for-aws) — it provides generic infrastructure skills (scaffolding, IAM, deployment, debugging) while this toolkit provides the domain-specific knowledge and tools for healthcare and life sciences.

### For Researchers (Amazon Quick)

Connect HCLS MCP servers directly in **Settings > Capabilities > Add MCP Server**. See [platforms/q-desktop/](platforms/q-desktop/) for setup.

### For Agent Deployments

Use `agentcore_template/` as your starting point and `agents_catalog/28-Research-agent-biomni-gateway-tools/` as your reference implementation.

```bash
cd agentcore_template
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
./scripts/prereq.sh
```

See the [AgentCore template](agentcore_template/) for full deployment instructions.

The portable interface layer makes catalog agent capabilities consumable across all surfaces — without deploying anything. The reference agents demonstrate best practices for scale, compliance, and determinism.
